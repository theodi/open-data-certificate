      <input type="url" placeholder="Dataset URL"/>
      <help>Link to the dataset you are certifying. By dataset we mean the documentation or metadata that describes the data as well as a link to the data file itself. Dataset = data + metadata.</help>

          <label>no, the data is not about people or their activities</label>
          <help>Remember that individuals can still be identified even if data isn't directly about them. For example, road traffic flow data combined with an individual's commuting patterns could reveal information about that person.</help>
