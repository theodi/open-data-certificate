# General Information
  dataTitle:
    text: What's a good title for this data?
    help_text: This is the title that we will give to the open data within the Open Data Certificate. It will probably be the same as what you call the data elsewhere, but you should aim to be unambiguous, and consider the fact that there might be certificates for lots of similar open data.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Data Title
  documentationUrl:
    text: Where is the data described?
    help_text: This should be the URL of a page that describes the open data and what it contains. This might be a page that describes the dataset within a catalog such as data.gov.uk. We ask for this page because it's useful for reusers to know about it, and because if it's written well then we can fill in a lot of things in this questionnaire based on the information within that page.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Documentation URL
  publisher:
    text: What's the name of the curating organisation?
    help_text: This is the organisation that the open data will be associated with the Open Data Certificate. It should be the organisation that manages the creation of and curates the open data. The data might actually be published by someone else, such as central government or a third-party contractor.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Data Curator
  publisherUrl:
    text: What's the website for the curating organisation?
    help_text: This should be the main website for your organisation or group. We use this to provide a link through to your organisation and to help us gather together all the open data curated by your organisation even if different people spell your organisation's name differently.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Curator URL
  releaseType:
    text: What kind of data release is this?
    answers:
      oneoff:
        text: a one-off release of a single dataset
        help_text: Choose this option if the open data release is the publication of a single file, such as a spreadsheet, with no intention to publish similar files in the future.
      collection:
        text: a one-off release of a set of related datasets
        help_text: Choose this option if the open data release is the publication of a collection of related files, such as several spreadsheets created from the same underlying data, with no intention to publish similar collections in the future.
      series:
        text: ongoing release of a series of related datasets
        help_text: Choose this open if you are releasing a series of datasets on a regular schedule, such as releasing a particular dataset every month.
      service:
        text: a service or API for accessing open data
        help_text: Choose this option if you are providing an API or a web service. This option includes linked data publications where underlying data is exposed through a website.
# Legal Information
  publisherRights:
    text: Do you have the rights to publish the data as open data?
    help_text: Unless all the data was originally created or gathered by your organisation, you might not have the right to republish it. We ask this question to check that you have considered the ownership of the data. If you aren't sure, we will ask further questions about the source of the data you're publishing to find out.
    answers:
      yes:
        text: yes, you have the right to publish the data as open data
      no:
        text: no, you don't have the right to publish the data as open data
      unsure:
        text: you don't know whether you have the right to publish the data as open data
  publisherOrigin:
    text: Was *all* this data originally created or gathered by you?
    help_text: If not all the data was originally created or gathered by you then you might not have the right to republish it. Answer 'no' to this question if the data includes information that was sourced from outside your organisation, or if it includes data that other individuals or organisations have contributed. We ask this question to work out whether we have to ask about other organisations or people who might own some of the data.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  thirdPartyOrigin:
    text: Was some of this data extracted or calculated from other data?
    help_text: You might have extracted data from another dataset, for example through an online service. Or you might have downloaded someone else's dataset and analysed it to create the data. In both these cases, we need to check that there are no legal barriers to you republishing the results of this data.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  thirdPartyOpen:
    text: Are *all* the other data sources published as open data by their owners?
    help_text: Open data is data that has been published under an open data licence or where the rights over that data have expired or been waived. If your data is created based on other data that is published as open data, then you can republish it. If your data incorporates data that is not published as open data, you will need to get legal advice to ensure that you can reuse that data and republish the results.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  crowdsourced:
    text: Was some of this data crowd-sourced?
    help_text: Crowd-sourcing involves collating data that is contributed by people operating outside your organisation. We ask about crowd-sourcing because if the data includes information that was contributed by others, you need to ensure that they granted their permission to publish their contributions as open data.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  crowdsourcedContent:
    text: Did contributions require judgement?
    help_text: The individuals who contributed to your data may have needed to employ their creativity or judgement to make their contributions. For example, writing a description or choosing whether or not to include some data in a dataset would require judgement. If judgement is involved, the contributors will have copyright over their contributions, so we will then need to check that they have transferred or waived their rights, or licensed the data, to you.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  claUrl:
    text: Where is the Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)?
    help_text: A Contributor Licence Agreement is an agreement with contributors that ensures that you can reuse the data that they contribute. It will either transfer the rights in the contributions to you, waive their rights, or license the data to you such that you can republish it.[Read more...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Contributor Licence Agreement URL
  cldsRecorded:
    text: Have all contributors agreed to the CLA?
    help_text: All contributors need to agree to a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) so that you can reuse or republish their contributions. You should keep a record of who has provided contributions and whether or not they have agreed to the CLA.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  sourceDocumentationUrl:
    text: Where do you describe the sources of the data?
    help_text: If not all the data was originally created or gathered by you then even if you have the rights to publish it, it is good practice to document where the data was sourced from (its provenance) and the rights under which you are publishing the data.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Data Sources Documentation URL
  sourceDocumentationMetadata:
    text: Does the documentation about the sources of the data include machine-readable data?
    help_text: The documentation about the sources of the data needs to be human-readable, so that reusers can work out what it says, but it also helps if it contains machine-readable metadata. This helps those people who publish open data to find out how their data is being used, which helps them to justify its ongoing publication.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  copyrightURL:
    text: Where is your copyright statement?
    help_text: A copyright statement states who owns the copyright and database rights in the data, and it says what you are allowing reusers can do with that data, usually by indicating its licence. We are asking where it is to check that you have one, to point reusers to it, and so we can automatically find out more about the terms under which you're making the data available.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Copyright Statement URL
  copyrightStatementMetadata:
    text: Does your copyright statement include machine-readable data for:
    help_text: If you have a copyright statement, it is good to embed within it machine-readable information about the licence under which you are making your data available. We can use this to automatically fill in parts of this questionnaire. Others can use it to automatically create attribution statements when they reuse your data.[Read more...](http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide/)

  dataLicence:
    text: Under which licence can others reuse the data?
    help_text: The creator of a database automatically gets database rights where they spend substantial effort gathering, verifying and presenting data. You need to have a waiver or a licence that covers the database rights in the data so reusers know that they can reuse it. The licences that are listed here are the ones that are most commonly used; if there are no database rights, they've expired, or you've waived them, choose 'Not applicable'. We ask about the licence because we want to make sure that the data is actually open for others to reuse from a legal perspective.

    answers:
      norights:
        text: there is no database right in this data
        help_text: You only have a database right in this data if you have spent substantial effort gathering, verifying or presenting the data. It's possible that there's no database right in the data, for example if the data is created from scratch, presented in an obvious way, and not checked against anything.
      expired:
        text: the applicable database rights have expired
        help_text: Database rights last for ten years. If the data was last changed more than ten years ago, then the database rights within it will have expired.
      waived:
        text: the applicable database rights have been waived
        help_text: You can waive your database rights, which means that no one owns them and anyone can do whatever they want with the data.
  dataWaiver:
    text: Which waiver are you using to waive database rights?
    help_text: If you waive your database right, you need to have a statement that says that you've done so, so that reusers know that they can do whatever they like with the data. There are existing waivers that you can use (PDDL and CCZero). You can author your own, but you should have legal advice if you do.

    answers:
      not_personal:
        text: no, the data is not about people or their activities
        help_text: Data does not have to be directly about individuals to enable people to be identified: anything about people's activities can be used to identify them if it's combined with other data. For example, data about road traffic flows is about people's activity and could be combined with other information (about an individual's commuting patterns) to reveal information about that individual.
      summarised:
        text: no, the data has been summarised so individuals can't be identified
        help_text: Data that is about individual people can be summarised using statistical analyses, so that individuals can no longer be identified.
      individual:
        text: yes, individuals *could* potentially be identified, for example by third parties with access to additional information
        help_text: You might be publishing data that is intended to provide information about individuals, such as civil service pay. Even if you are not, it is seldom possible to completely guarantee that individuals cannot be identified from data about them.

    answers:
      static:
        text: no, the API simply provides easy access to unchanging data
        help_text: Some APIs are created by processing a single unchanging dataset: the purpose of the API is to make accessing this data easier, particularly when there is lots of that data.
      changing:
        text: yes, the API provides instant access to changing data
        help_text: Some APIs are created over changeable data, and the primary purpose of the API is to provide up-to-date access to this data.
  timeSensitive:
    text: Will this data go out of date?
    answers:
      true:
        text: yes, this data will go out of date over time
        help_text: For example, a dataaset that contains the current location of bus stops will go out of date over time, as some bus stops are moved or new bus stops created.
      timestamped:
        text: yes, this data will go out of date over time but the data is timestamped
        help_text: For example, demography statistics usually include a timestamp to indicate the time at which the statistics were relevant.
      false:
        text: no, this data does not contain any time-sensitive information
        help_text: For example, a dataset that contains the results of an experiment will not go out of date because the data accurately reports the results of the experiment.
  frequentChanges:
    text: Does the data you capture change on at least a daily basis?
    help_text: Indicate whether you create or gather new data continuously, such that the underlying data changes most days. We ask about this because when data changes frequently it also goes out of date quickly, so we need to check that the releases that you are making are also made quickly and frequently.

For example, you would choose this option if you had a database of bus stops and created a new, updated, version of that dataset every day. We ask this because when you are creating database dumps, it is often useful for reusers to be able to access a feed of the changes to the database so that they can keep their copies up to date.
      aggregate:
        text: regular aggregates of changing data
        help_text: Select this option if you are creating new datasets at regular intervals. This might be because you are creating aggregates because the underlying data cannot be released as open data. Or it might be that you only publish the data that is new since the last publication.
  changeFeed:
    text: Is a feed of changes made available?
    help_text: Indicate whether you make available a feed of the changes that occur to the data that you capture, such as new entries or amendments to existing entries. A feed might be in a format such as RSS or Atom, or a custom data format.

  frequentSeriesPublication:
    text: How frequently do you create a new release?
    help_text: We ask about the frequency with which you publish new datasets in the series because this determines how out of date the data that you are making available will get before reusers can get an update to their data.
    answers:
      rarely:
        text: less frequently than once a month
      monthly:
        text: at least every month

      daily:
        text: at least every day
  seriesPublicationDelay:
    text: What is the delay between creating a dataset and publishing it?
    answers:
      extreme:
        text: longer than the gap between releases
        help_text: For example, if you are creating a new version of the dataset every day, then choose this option if it takes more than a day for the dataset to then be published.
      reasonable:
        text: about the same as the gap between releases
        help_text: For example, if you are creating a new version of the dataset every day, then choose this option if it takes about a day for the dataset to then be published.
      good:
        text: less than half the gap between releases
        help_text: For example, if you are creating a new version of the dataset every day, then choose this option if it takes less than twelve hours for the data to then be published.
      minimal:
        text: there is minimal or no delay
        help_text: Choose this option if the delay is in the order of a few seconds if the datasets are created frequently, or a few minutes if they are made less frequently.
  provideDumps:
    text: Do you also provide dumps of the dataset?
    help_text: A dump is an extract of the data into a static file that developers can download to get hold of the whole dataset. Being able to access a dump of the whole dataset enables different kinds of analyses than API access.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  dumpFrequency:
    text: How frequently do you create a new dump?
    help_text: Providing new database dumps within a short period ensures that new developers can get started with up-to-date data whenever they start looking at the data.
    answers:
      rarely:
        text: less frequently than once a month
      monthly:
        text: at least every month
      weekly:
        text: within a week of any change
      daily:
        text: within a day of any change
  corrected:
    text: Will this data be corrected if it contains errors?
    help_text: Indicate whether the data will be corrected in cases where errors are discovered within the data. We ask this because it is good practice to correct data that is revealed to contain errors (especially as you should be using this data yourself), and because if you do correct the data you need to provide additional support for reusers who will need to be informed of these corrections.

  qualityUrl:
    text: Where are known issues with the quality of the data documented?
    help_text: There are usually areas within any non-trivial data where there are known quality problems. For example, maybe the equipment that collected the data malfunctioned for a day, or the data was migrated between two systems and errors crept in during that migration. Documenting these helps reusers to have a better understanding of the data that they are using.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Quality Issues URL
  qualityControlUrl:
    text: Where is your quality control process described?
    help_text: A quality control process checks the quality of the data on an ongoing basis, either by hand or automatically, or through a combination of techniques. Having a publicly available description of your quality control process reassures reusers that you are checking the quality of the data that you are making available, and helps them to identify places that could be improved.

      a_1:
        text: Quality Control Process Description URL
  serviceAvailability:
    text: What is the guaranteed availability of the service?
    help_text: You will probably have in place a service-level agreement (SLA) with the service provider for the servers that you are using to host the data. These SLAs should indicate guaranteed up-time for the servers, and hence the availability of your data.
    answers:
      minimal:

# Technical Information
  datasetUrl:
    text: What's the URL of the dataset?
    help_text: This should be the URL of the dataset itself (for example a CSV file). This is a different URL from the page that describes the dataset. We ask this to ensure that the dataset is available on the web, and that it can be linked to directly, as this helps reusers to access the data.
    answers:
      a_1:

  versionManagement:
    text: How do you publish the datasets in the series?
    answers:
      current:
        text: the data at a single "current" dataset URL is regularly updated
        help_text: Having a single "current" dataset URL means that there is one URL from which reusers can always download the most recent version of the dataset.
      template:
        text: the URLs for each release follow a regular pattern
        help_text: Having URLs that follow a regular pattern means publishing datsets at URLs where the date of publication is part of the URL itself. For example, if you published a dataset each month then you would include the month (eg `2013-04`) as part of the URL. This helps reusers to understand when the dataset dates from, and helps them write scripts that collect together all the published datasets or fetch new ones each time they're released.
      list:
        text: you publish a list of the releases
        help_text: Having a list of the releases means having a web page or a feed (such as Atom or RSS) that contains details of each release, including a link through to each individual release and a description of when it dates from. Reusers can use these lists to understand the frequency and regularity of your publication, and to help them write scripts that collect together all the published datasets or fetch new ones each time they're released.
  currentDatasetUrl:
    text: What's the URL of the current dataset?
    help_text: This should be the single URL that always gives the current version of the dataset itself (for example a CSV file). The content at this URL should change each time a new version is released. This should not be a page describing the dataset.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Current Dataset URL
  versionsTemplateUrl:
    text: What's the URL template for the releases?
    help_text: This should be a template that outlines the structure of the URLs that are used when publishing different releases. Use `{<var>variable</var>}` within the URL template to indicate changeable parts of the URL. For example `http://example.com/data/monthly/mydata-{YY}{MM}.csv`

      a_1:
        text: Version Template URL
  versionsUrl:
    text: What's the URL that gives a list of releases?
    help_text: This should be the URL of a page or feed that provides a machine-readable list of the previous versions of the dataset. If the list goes over several pages, then give the URL of the first page and make sure there are links to other pages.
    answers:
      a_1:
        text: Version List URL
  endpointUrl:
    text: What's the endpoint for the API?
    help_text: This should be a URL that provides a starting point for scripts that access the API. If the API supports it, this should be a service description document, which enables the script to work out the kinds of services that are offered by the API.

        help_text: Having a single "current" dump URL means that there is one URL from which reusers can always download the most recently created dump.
      template:
        text: the URLs for each release follow a regular pattern
        help_text: Having URLs that follow a regular pattern means publishing dumps at URLs where the date of publication is part of the URL itself. For example, if you published a dump each month then you would include the month (eg `2013-04`) as part of the URL. This helps reusers to understand when the dump dates from, and helps them write scripts that collect together all the published dumps (to carry out comparisons, for example) or fetch new ones each time they're released.
      list:
        text: you publish a list of the releases
        help_text: Having a list of the dumps means having a web page or a feed (such as Atom or RSS) that contains details of each dump, including a link through to each individual release and a description of when it dates from.

  machineReadable:
    text: Is the data machine-readable?
    help_text: A machine-readable format is one in which the information can be easily extracted from the data by a computer. For example, scanned photocopies of spreadsheets would not be machine-readable, but a CSV file would be.

    text: What kind of data are you publishing?
    answers:
      documents:
        text: human-readable documents
        help_text: Human-readable documents are those that are intended for human consumption. Examples would be policy documents, white papers, reports, meeting minutes and so on. These will usually have some structure to them, but the majority of the information within them is text.
      statistical:
        text: statistical data, such as counts, averages and percentages
        help_text: Statistical data includes numeric data such as counts, averages or percentages. Examples would be census results, traffic flow information or crime statistics.
      geographic:
        text: geographic information, such as points and boundaries
        help_text: Geographic information is any data that can be plotted on a map. These may be points or boundaries or lines.
      structured:
        text: other kinds of structured data
        help_text: Other kinds of structured data would include things like event details, railway timetables, contact information: anything that can be interpreted as data, analysed and presented in multiple ways.
  documentFormat:
    text: Do the formats used for documents include:
    answers:
      semantic:
        text: one that exposes the semantic structure of documents, such as HTML, Docbook or Markdown
        help_text: Documents are typically structured into chapters or sections, with headings and tables, lists and figures, terms and their definitions. Formats such as HTML, Docbook and Markdown that label these structures make it easy to automatically create summaries such as tables of contents and glossaries, and make it easy to apply different styling to the document to make it appear differently.
      format:
        text: one that focuses on the format of documents, such as OOXML or PDF
        help_text: Because documents are made for human consumption, they are typically created with great emphasis on how the document looks. Formats such as OOXML and PDF emphasise appearance: the use of particular fonts and colours and the positioning of different elements within the page. These are good for human consumption, but (despite being machine-readable) aren't as easy for machines to process or re-style.
      unsuitable:
        text: only those not designed for documents, such as Excel, JSON or CSV
        help_text: Formats such as Excel or CSV are suited to tabular data. Formats such as JSON are suited for structured data. Because of the way they are structured, documents aren't suited to these formats.
  statisticalFormat:
    text: Do the formats used for statistical data include:
    answers:
      statistical:
        text: one that exposes the structure of the statistical hypercube data, such as SDMX or Data Cube
        help_text: Statistical data typically fits into a hypercube in which individual observations are related to a particular measure and a set of dimensions. Each observation may also be related to a number of annotations that provide additional context. Formats such as [SDMX](http://sdmx.org/) and [Data Cube](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) are designed to express this underlying structure of statistical data.
      tabular:
        text: one that treats the statistical data as a table, such as CSV
        help_text: Statistical data can be arranged within a table of rows and columns. This lacks the expressiveness about the underlying hypercube, but is easy to process.
      format:
        text: one that focuses on the format of tabular data, such as Excel
        help_text: Excel and other spreadsheet formats typically emphasise the appearance of data, using italic or bold text, or indentation within fields, or the width of lines between rows, to indicate its underlying structure. This styling helps humans to understand the meaning of the data, but is hard for computers to interpret, and thus makes the data less reusable than it might otherwise be.
      unsuitable:
        text: only those not designed for statistical or tabular data, such as Word or PDF
        help_text: Formats that are oriented towards human-readable documents, such as Word or PDF, are not suitable for statistical data, as they completely obscure the underlying structure of the data.
  geographicFormat:
    text: Do the formats used for geographic data include:
    answers:
      specific:
        text: one designed for geographic data, such as KML or GeoJSON
        help_text: Geographic data describes points, lines and boundaries. Formats that are designed for geographic data expose these kinds of structures in the data, which makes it easier to process automatically.
      generic:
        text: a generic structured data format, such as JSON, XML or CSV
        help_text: Geographic data can be expressed using any format that can be used for normal structured data, particularly if it only holds data about points.
      unsuitable:
        text: only those not designed for geographic data, such as Word or PDF
        help_text: Formats that are oriented towards human-readable documents, such as Word or PDF, are not suitable for geographic data, as they completely obscure the underlying structure of the data.
  structuredFormat:
    text: Do the formats used for structured data include:
    answers:
      suitable:
        text: one designed for structured data, such as JSON, XML, Turtle or CSV
        help_text: Structured data formats break down data into a basic structure of things which have values for a known set of properties. These predictable formats are easy for machines to process.
      unsuitable:
        text: only those not designed for structured data, such as Word or PDF
        help_text: Formats that are oriented towards human-readable documents, such as Word or PDF, are not suitable for structured data, as they completely obscure its underlying structure.
  identifiers:
    text: Are you using URLs to identify things in the data?
    help_text: Data is usually about things, often things in the real world such as schools and roads. Identifying these things using URLs provides a mechanism for people to find out more about the thing that is being described by the data. If data from different sources consistently uses the same URL to refer to the same thing, those different data sources can be combined easily, to create more useful data. URLs can usefully be used in place of identifying numbers or codes.

        text: yes
  resolvingUrls:
    text: Do the URLs resolve to information about those things?
    help_text: A URL that resolves to information about something is one that, when put in a browser, provides you with additional data. For example there are resolvable URLs for [companies](http://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/08030289) and [postcodes](http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/doc/postcodeunit/EC2A4JE). These provide human-readable pages but are also linked to underlying data which scripts can process.

        text: yes
  existingExternalUrls:
    text: Do external URLs exist for any of those things?
    help_text: These may be other websites, outside your control, that provide URLs for the things that you are naming through URLs within your data. For example, your data might include postcodes, when there are URLs for postcodes that are supported on the Ordnance Survey website.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  reliableExternalUrls:
    text: Do those external URLs serve reliable data?
    help_text: Just because other websites support URLs for things (such as companies or postcodes), that doesn't necessarily make those sites reliable. However, often if a publisher has gone to the trouble of supporting URLs for things, they will have taken other steps to ensure the data quality and reliability. You can see, for example, if the data has an open data certificate. Whether you consider the website reliable is a judgement call.
    answers:
      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  externalUrls:
    text: Does the data use those external URLs?
    help_text: If there are URLs that resolve to reliable data for the things that you are describing in your data, you should reuse those URLs in your data. This reduces the duplication and enhances the ability for data from different sources to be brought together.

      a_false:
        text: no
      a_true:
        text: yes
  provenance:
    text: Do you provide machine-readable provenance for the data?
    help_text: The provenance of data is a trace of how it was created and processed prior to publication. This can help establish trust in the data that you are publishing by enabling reusers to trace back how the data has been handled.[Read more...](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/)

  digitalCertificate:
    text: Where do you describe how reusers can verify the data they receive?
    help_text: If you are delivering important data, reusers should be able to verify that the data that they receive is the same as the data that you are publishing. For example, you might digitally sign the data that you publish, so that reusers can tell if it has been tampered with.
