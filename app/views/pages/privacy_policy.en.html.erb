<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/">You have rights over what is done with data that is about you</a>. You can contact us at datacontroller@theodi.org if you want to get a copy of that data. You can also ask us to update it, delete it or stop using it.</p>

<h2>What data do we collect and why?</h2>

<p>When you register with this website, we ask for and keep the following:</p>

<p>We also collect data as you use this website about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what pages you access, so that we know what content is popular</li>

<h2>How do we use this data?</h2>

<p>We use this data to:</p>

<p>We may also need to share this data with the authorities if they ask us to do so.</p>
