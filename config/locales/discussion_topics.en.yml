    dataTitle: "People see the name of your open data in a list of similar ones so make this as unambiguous and descriptive as you can in this tiny box so they quickly identify what's unique about it."
    group_2: "your right to share this data with people"
    group_6: "how you help people find your data"
    group_11: "how people can access your data"
    group_15: "how you help people understand the context and content of your data"
    documentationUrl: "Give a URL for people to read about the contents of your open data and find more detail. It can be a page within a bigger catalog like data.gov.uk."
    publisherRights: "If your organisation didn't originally create or gather this data then you might not have the right to publish it. If you’re not sure, check with the data owner because you will need their permission to publish it."
    linkedTo: "If documentation is reachable via links from the home page of the site it's published on, people can find it quickly without searching. You should make it more accessible on your website if they can't."
    datasetUrl: "Give a URL to the dataset itself. Open data should be linked to directly on the web so people can easily find and reuse it."
    publisherOrigin: "If any part of this data was sourced outside your organisation by other individuals or organisations then you need to give extra information about your right to publish it."
    listed: "Data is easier for people to find when it's in relevant data catalogs like academic, public or health for example, or when it turns up in relevant search results."
    publisher: "Give the name of the organisation who publishes this data. It’s probably who you work for unless you’re doing this on behalf of someone else."
    thirdPartyOrigin: "An extract or smaller part of someone else's data still means your rights to use it might be affected. There might also be legal issues if you analysed their data to produce new results from it."
    publisherUrl: "Give a URL to a website, this helps us to group data from the same organisation even if people give different names."
    listing: "Give a URL where this data is listed within a relevant collection. For example, data.gov.uk (if it's UK public sector data), hub.data.ac.uk (if it's UK academia data) or a URL for search engine results."
    thirdPartyOpen: "You're allowed to republish someone else's data if it's already under an open data licence or if their rights have expired or been waived. If any part of your data is not like this then you'll need legal advice before you can publish it."
    referenced: "When you reference your data within your own publications, such as reports, presentations or blog posts, you give it more context and help people find and understand it better."
    crowdsourced: "If your data includes information contributed by people outside your organisation, you need their permission to publish their contributions as open data."
    reference: "Give a URL to a document that cites or references this data."
    group_7: "how you keep your data up-to-date"
    currentDatasetUrl: "Give a single URL to the most recent version of the dataset. The content at this URL should change each time a new version is released."
    crowdsourcedContent: "If people used their creativity or judgement to contribute data then they have copyright over their work. For example, writing a description or deciding whether or not to include some data in a dataset would require judgement. So contributors must transfer or waive their rights, or license the data to you before you can publish it."
    versionsTemplateUrl: "This is the structure of URLs when you publish different releases. Use `{variable}` to indicate parts of the template URL that change, for example, `http://example.com/data/monthly/mydata-{YY}{MM}.csv`"
    claUrl: "Give a link to an agreement that shows contributors allow you to reuse their data. A CLA will either transfer contributor's rights to you, waive their rights, or license the data to you so you can publish it."
    versionsUrl: "Give a URL to a page or feed with a machine-readable list of datasets. Use the URL of the first page which should link to the rest of the pages."
    cldsRecorded: "Check all contributors agree to a CLA before you reuse or republish their contributions. You should keep a record of who gave contributions and whether or not they agree to the CLA."
    endpointUrl: "Give a URL that's a starting point for people's scripts to access your API. This should be a service description document that helps the script to work out which services exist."
    sourceDocumentationUrl: "Give a URL that documents where your data was sourced from (its provenance) and the rights under which you publish the data. Do this even if the data wasn't originally created or gathered by you and even though you have the rights to publish it."
    frequentChanges: "Tell people if the underlying data changes on most days. When data changes frequently it also goes out of date quickly, so people need to know if you also update it frequently and quickly too."
    sourceDocumentationMetadata: "Information about data sources should be human-readable so people can understand it, as well as in a metadata format that computers can process. When everyone does this it helps other people find out how the same open data is being used and justify its ongoing publication."
    changeFeed: "Tell people if you provide a stream of changes that affect this data, like new entries or amendments to existing entries. Feeds might be in RSS, Atom or custom formats."
    group_3: "how you give people permission to use your data"
    frequentSeriesPublication: "This determines how out of date this data becomes before people can get an update."
    copyrightURL: "Give a URL to a rights statement which shows who owns copyright and database rights to the data. This statement also says what you allow people to do with this data under licence and it helps them understand the terms under which you make it available."
    currentDumpUrl: "Give a URL to the most recent dump of the database. The content at this URL should change each time a new database dump is created."
    dumpsTemplateUrl: "This is the structure of URLs when you publish different releases. Use `{variable}` to indicate parts of the template URL that change, for example, `http://example.com/data/monthly/mydata-{YY}{MM}.csv`"
    copyrightStatementMetadata: "It's good practice to embed information about licences in machine-readable formats so people can automatically attribute your data back to you when they use it."
    dumpsUrl: "Give a URL to a page or feed with a machine-readable list of database dumps. Use the URL of the first page which should link to the rest of the pages."
    changeFeedUrl: "Give a URL to a page or feed that provides a machine-readable list of the previous versions of the database dumps. Use the URL of the first page which should link to the rest of the pages."
    group_12: "how people can work with your data"
    vocabulary: "Formats like CSV, JSON, XML or Turtle use custom vocabularies or schemas which say what columns or properties the data contains."
    machineReadable: "People prefer data formats which are easily processed by a computer, for speed and accuracy. For example, a scanned photocopy of a spreadsheet would not be machine-readable but a CSV file would be."
    dataLicence: "Remember that whoever originally gathers, creates, verifies or presents a database automatically gets rights over it. So people need a waiver or a licence which proves that they can use the data and explains how they can do that legally. We list the most common licenses here; if there are no database rights, they've expired, or you've waived them, choose 'Not applicable'."
    provideDumps: "A dump is an extract of the whole dataset into a file that people can download. This lets people do analysis that's different to analysis with API access."
    openStandard: "Open standards are created through a fair, transparent and collaborative process. Anyone can implement them and there’s lots of support so it’s easier for you to share data with more people. For example, XML, CSV and JSON are open standards."
    codelists: "If your data uses codes to refer to things like geographical areas, spending categories or diseases for example, these need to be explained to people."
    dataWaiver: "You need a statement to show people you've done this so that they understand they can do whatever they like with this data. Standard waivers already exist like PDDL and CCZero but you can write your own with legal advice."
    dataOtherWaiver: "Give a URL to your own publicly available waiver so people can check that it does waive your database rights."
    dumpFrequency: "Faster access to more frequent extracts of the whole dataset means people can get started quicker with the most up-to-date data."
    otherDataLicenceName: "If you use a different licence, we need the name so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate."
    group_16: "how you communicate with people who use your data"
    otherDataLicenceURL: "Give a URL to the licence, so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate and check that it's publicly available."
    contactEmail: "Give an email address that people can send questions about the data to."
    otherDataLicenceOpen: "If you aren't sure what an open licence is then read the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Knowledge Definition</a> definition. Next, choose your licence from the <a href=\"http://licenses.opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition Advisory Board open licence list</a>. If a licence isn't in their list, it's either not open or hasn't been assessed yet."
    corrected: "It's good practice to fix errors in your data especially if you use it yourself. When you make corrections, people need to be told about them."
    contentLicence: "Remember that whoever spends intellectual effort creating content automatically gets rights over it but creative content does not include facts. So people need a waiver or a licence which proves that they can use the content and explains how they can do that legally. We list the most common licenses here; if there is no copyright in the content, it's expired, or you've waived them, choose 'Not applicable'."
    group_8: "how much people can rely on your data"
    contentWaiver: "You need a statement to show people you've done this, so they understand that they can do whatever they like with this data. Standard waivers already exist like PDDL and CCZero but you can write your own with legal advice."
    qualityUrl: "Give a URL where people can find out about the quality of your data. People accept that errors are inevitable, from equipment malfunctions or mistakes that happen in system migrations. You should be open about quality so people can judge how much to rely on this data."
    contentOtherWaiver: "Give a URL to your own publicly available waiver so people can check that it does waive your copyright."
    otherContentLicenceName: "If you use a different licence, we need its name so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate."
    qualityControlUrl: "Give a URL for people to learn about ongoing checks on your data, either automatic or manual. This reassures them that you take quality seriously and encourages improvements that benefit everyone."
    otherContentLicenceURL: "Give a URL to the licence, so people can see it on your Open Data Certificate and check that it's publicly available."
    account: "Give URLs to your social media accounts, like your Twitter or Facebook profile page."
    otherContentLicenceOpen: "If you aren't sure what an open licence is then read the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Knowledge Definition</a> definition. Next, choose your licence from the <a href=\"http://licenses.opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition Advisory Board open licence list</a>. If a licence isn't in their list, it's either not open or hasn't been assessed yet."
    group_9: "how much people can depend on your data’s availability"
    forum: "Give a URL to your forum or mailing list where people can talk about your data."
    serviceAvailability: "Most server hosting providers have a service-level agreement (SLA) between you and them. This should guarantee uptime for the servers and determine the availability of your data."
    group_4: "how you protect people's privacy"
    identifiers: "Data is usually about real things like schools or roads or uses a coding scheme. If data from different sources use the same persistent and unique identifier to refer to the same things, people can combine sources easily to create more useful data. Identifiers might be GUIDs, DOIs or URLs."
    correctionReporting: "Give a URL where people can report errors they spot in your data."
    correctionDiscovery: "Give a URL where you describe how notifications about corrections are shared with people."
    appliedAnon: "Anonymisation reduces the risk of individuals being identified from the data you publish. The best technique to use depends on the kind of data you have and this is explored in the <a href=\"http://www.ico.org.uk/news/latest_news/2012/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/anonymisation_code.ashx\">ICO Anonymisation Code of Practice</a>."
    resolutionServiceURL: "The resolution service should take an identifier as a query parameter and give back some information about the thing it identifies."
    existingExternalUrls: "Sometimes other people outside your control provide URLs to the things your data is about. For example, your data might have postcodes in it that link to the Ordnance Survey website."
    group_17: "how you give people access to tools they need to work with your data"
    reliableExternalUrls: "If a third-party provides public URLs about things in your data, they probably take steps to ensure data quality and reliability. This is a measure of how much you trust their processes to do that. Look for their open data certificate or similar hallmarks to help make your decision."
    libraries: "Give a URL that lists the tools you know or recommend people can use when they work with your data."
    privacyImpactAssessmentExists: "A <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/privacy_impact_assessment.aspx\">Privacy Impact Assessment</a> is how you measure risks to the privacy of individuals in your data as well as the use and disclosure of that information."
    externalUrls: "You should use third-party URLs that resolve to information about the things your data describes. This reduces duplication and helps people combine data from different sources to make it more useful."
    privacyImpactAssessmentUrl: "Give a URL to where people can check how you have assessed the privacy risks to individuals. This may be redacted or summarised if it contains sensitive information."
    group_13: "how much trust people can put in your data"
    provenance: "This about the origins of how your data was created and processed before it was published. It builds trust in the data you publish because people can trace back how it has been handled."
    piaAudited: "It's good practice to check your assessment was done correctly. Independent audits by specialists or third-parties tend to be more rigorous and impartial."
    digitalCertificate: "If you deliver important data to people they should be able to check that what they receive is the same as what you published. For example, you can digitally sign the data you publish, so people can tell if it has been tampered with."
    individualConsentURL: "When you collect data about individuals you must tell them how that data will be used. People who use your data need this to make sure they comply with the Data Protection Act."
    anonymisationAudited: "It is good practice to make sure your process to remove personal identifiable data works properly. Independent audits by specialists or third-parties tend to be more rigorous and impartial."
