## ODI Open Data Certificate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theodi/open-data-certificate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theodi/open-data-certificate) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/519228b056b10279600066b5/badges/772e6d53c060a1268449/gpa.png)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/519228b056b10279600066b5/feed) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/theodi/open-data-certificate.png)](https://gemnasium.com/theodi/open-data-certificate)

The original prototype has been moved to [/prototype](https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/tree/master/prototype).

### API

Certificates can be created and updated using the JSON API.

The API methods are:

- GET `/jurisdictions` - This method provides a list of the available jurisdictions and associated information
- GET `/datasets/schema` - This method provides the list of questions, their types and possible choices. You must specify your jurisdiction by title with the `jursidiction` GET parameter
- POST `/datasets` - This method allows you to create a new dataset, it will be automatically published if valid
- POST `/datasets/:id/certificates` - This method allows you to update a dataset, it will be automatically published if valid


#### Authentication

Each user can access their API token from their account page. This token is required to authenticate with the API.
The request should authenticated with Basic HTTP Authentication, using the user's email address as the username and token as the password i.e. `john@example.com:ad54965ec45d78ab6f`.


#### Questionnaire schema

The schema method returns a hash where each question is identified by its key in the hash. Each question also has one of the following types: `string`, `radio`, `checkbox` and `repeating`. Radio and checkbox types will also have an options hash, which specifies the allowed options, which should be identified by their key.

Questions which are required to publish the dataset will also have `required: true`.

An example:

    {"schema": {
        "dataTitle": {
            "question": "What's a good title for this data?",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true
        },
        "publisherRights": {
            "question": "Do you have the rights to publish the data as open data?",
            "type": "radio",
            "required": true,
            "options": {
                "yes": "yes, you have the right to publish the data as open data",
                "no": "no, you don't have the right to publish the data as open data",
                "unsure": "you don't know whether you have the right to publish the data as open data"
            }
        },
        "versionManagement": {
            "question": "How do you publish a series of the same dataset?",
            "type": "checkbox",
            "required": false,
            "options": {
                "url": "as a single URL",
                "consistent": "as consistent URLs for each release",
                "list": "as a list of releases"
            }
        },
        "administrators": {
            "question": "Who is responsible for administrating this data?",
            "type": "repeating",
            "required": false
        }
    }}

#### Posting to a dataset

To create or update a dataset data should be sent in the format (using the above schema):

    {
        "jurisdiction": "GB",
        "dataset": {
            "dataTitle": "My open data",
            "publisherRights": "unsure",
            "versionManagement": ["url", "list"],
            "administrators": ["John Smith"]
        }
    }


- Checkbox and radio fields should use the option key from the schema
- Checkbox and repeating fields should be sent as an array

### Surveyor

The Open Data Certificate uses [surveyor](https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor) to generate and display the data questionnaires.  We've changed the look, feel & structure to fit the site and extended it to support certificate levels.

Although all of Surveyor's functionality is supported - much of it isn't incorporated into the initial designs, and so hasn't been tested to work correctly. Experiments with the demo "kitchen sink survey" illustrate that some of the question types that Surveyor supports break the CSS, so please beware if extending the current questionnaire with other question types - they will need to be tested and possibly need CSS/renderer design changes.


#### Deploying questionnaires

Any changed surveys can be generated by running a rake task:

```bash
# build all surveys in ./surveys
rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys

# specify a survey directory
rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys DIR=surveys/development
```

#### Survey versions

When a survey is updated and re-imported, it will be imported as a new version of the survey.

The identity of a survey is judged by the title (the string following `survey` on the first line of the survey dsl).  This is [transformed slightly](https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor/blob/f90c38ff3ac29e9e9493bd2df3fa718393bd1f85/lib/surveyor/models/survey_methods.rb#L35-L38) from "My awesome title!!1" to "my-awesome-title"

With this in mind, be careful:

* that different survey files have unique names
* that changing the name of the survey might be painful.


#### Surveyor extensions

We've extended surveyor with some attributes for the Open Data Certificate.

##### requirement

A 'Requirement' is a bar that needs to be passed to contribute to attaining a certain level in the questionnaire.
This is not the same as being "required" - which is about whether a question is mandatory to be completed.
For the moment, requirements are stored in the questions database table as labels with a 'requirement' attribute set.

Questions and Answers are associated to requirements by having their 'requirement' attribute set as the same value. Thus; for every label with a requirement set, there should be a question (or an answer) with the same value set.

##### survey

* `:dataset_curator` - Identifies (by its 'reference_identifier' value) which form element should be used to populate the dataset curator field (currently `publisher`).

* `:dataset_title` - Identifies (by its 'reference_identifier' value) which form element should be used to populate the dataset title field (currently `dataTitle`)

* `:description` - Copy to be displayed above the questionnaire

* `:default_locale_name` - When there are multiple translations, this is the friendly name for the default one (the others are defined in the translation files)

##### section

* `:display_header` - Whether the header should be displayed on the header (defaults to true)

##### question

* `:requirment` - If the question is a Label-type, requirement is the identifier of an improvement that is recommended to meet a certain level.
The value will be stored as `"pilot_1"`, `"pilot_2"`, `"pilot_3"`, `"basic_1"`, `"basic_2"`, etc. With the part before the underscore representing the level, and everything after the underscore uniquely identifying the requirement.
If the question is a "normal" question (ie: not a label), the requirement attribute is used to identify to the recommended improvement this question satisfies.

* `:required` - Whether or not this question is required/mandatory to be completed (it also has to be triggered in the questionnaire by its dependencies). Any value in here will make the question mandatory, but it can also be used to identify if it is mandatory for a specific level of certificate attainment (if this requires different styling in the UI) ie: `:required #=> mandatory for every level`  , `:pilot #=> mandatory for 'pilot' level`

* `:help_text_more_url` - The url to link to at the end of the help text

* `:text_as_statement` - How the text should appear when it's displayed on the certificate (eg. "What is your name?" should read as "Name")

* `:display_on_certificate` - If the question should appear on the certificate

* `:discussion_topic` - Sets the topic (and enables) juvia discussion for this question (accessible by clicking "Ask for help with this question").  The `:help_text` value for this question will appear at the top of the discussion page.

##### answer

* `:requirement` - Identifies the recommended improvement that this answer satisfies.

* `:help_text_more_url` - as above

* `:text_as_statement` - as above

* `:input_type` - alternative input types (eg. url, number, phone)

* `:placeholder` - placeholder text displayed in a field before anything is entered

### Translations

Questionnaires are able to be translated and a user can select the locale when they are filling them out.

To enable this for a questionnaire:

* specify a `default_locale_name` for the survey
* set any alternative translations files using the `translations` method (eg. `:es => 'translations/my-file.es.yml'`)

In the translation file (eg. surveys/translations/my-file.es.yml)

* set the locale name with `es: Spanish` (where 'es' was the reference given in the survey file)

There is an example of adding a translation on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/benfoxall/c35ad597fd2c2d7fcdc6#file-0002-manually-corrected-translation-yaml-patch)


### Running

```bash
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake surveyor:build_changed_survey FILE=surveys/odc_questionnaire.UK.rb
rails s

# to include some other jurisdictions
rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys LIMIT=5
```


#### Development things

```bash
# generate a stripped back version of the default survey (GB)
# - makes page loads more bearable in development
rake surveyor:build_changed_survey FILE=surveys/development/odc_GB_stub.rb

# generate development surveys (includes GB stub)
rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys DIR=surveys/development

# run tests on file change
bundle exec guard
```


#### Environment variables

Some environment variables are required for the certificates site, these can be set in a .env file in the root of the project.

```
# Rackspace credentials for saving certificate dumps
RACKSPACE_USERNAME
RACKSPACE_API_KEY
RACKSPACE_CERTIFICATE_DUMP_CONTAINER

# Juvia details to allow commenting
JUVIA_BASE_URL
CERTIFICATE_JUVIA_SITE_KEY

# Sending error reports to airbrake
AIRBRAKE_CERTIFICATE_KEY
```


#### Admin functions

To mark a user as being an admin - the users ID should be included in the `ODC_ADMIN_IDS` environment variable (comma separated).  The easiest way to find the ID is to look on the URL of their account page.

Admins are able to block a dataset from displaying on the public /datasets page by visiting the dataset and toggling the visibility at the top of the page.

Removed datasets are listed at `/datasets/admin` (only accessible by admin users).


#### Changing surveys

To change surveys, you'll need Saxon installed. On a Mac, this is as simple as running:

```bash
brew install saxon
```

You can then change the `prototype/survey.xsl` file and run:

```bash
saxon -s:prototype/jurisdictions/ -xsl:prototype/surveyor.xsl -o:prototype/temp/
```

### Autocompletion

The survey attempts to fetch answers from the documentation URL and fill them into the questionnaire. These answers are marked as autocompleted.

Some examples of URLS that can be autocompleted:

- http://data.gov.uk/dataset/overseas_travel_and_tourism
- http://data.gov.uk/dataset/apprenticeship-success-rates-in-england-2011-2012
- http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/datasets/50k-gazetteer
- http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/datasets/boundary-line
- http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/download/

The approach to the new app is outlined in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/whiteoctober.co.uk/document/d/1Ot91x1enq9TW7YKpePytE-wA0r8l9dmNQLVi16ph-zg/edit#), which will be moved into this readme file.
