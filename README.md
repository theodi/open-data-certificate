# ODI Open Data Certificate

The [ODI's Open Data Certificate](http://theodi.github.com/open-data-certificate/certificate.html) specifies what good open data looks like in four main categories:

  * **Legal Information** about the licence, ownership and privacy implications of the data
  * **Practical Information** about the timeliness, quality and sustainability of the data
  * **Technical Information** about where the data can be found and its format
  * **Social Information** about how to engage with the data owner and others about the data
  
A certificate can be awarded at one of four levels:

  * a **basic certificate** is for data that meets the fundamental requirements for open data
  * a **pilot certificate** is for initial forays into publishing open data, which provides enough to prompt experimentation with data
  * a **standard certificate** is for routinely published open data that encourages reuse
  * a **established certificate** is for open data that provides reliable key information infrastructure

These levels are chosen to illustrate both that opening data is a journey, and that you don't have to do everything straight away, and to show that not all open data needs to be published with the same degree of investment.

There are two primary goals for the Open Data Certificate:

  * to provide data holders with something they can point to and have as a badge of honour that shows how well they are doing open data
  * to provide data holders with concrete ideas about how they could improve the way in which they are publishing or supporting open data

There are a few side effects that are also beneficial for the community:

  * individual certificates can provide access to the information that data reusers need to help them understand how they can reuse the data
  * the set of certificates that's granted can give us as a community access to metrics about not just how much data is being opened but how they are being released
  * the process of working out what questions the certificates should ask helps to explore some of the subtle issues and trade-offs around opening up data

Best practices in open data will change as time goes on. Certificates will only be valid for a year, to prompt data publishers to continue to improve their provision.

## Alpha Version
  
The [current version](http://theodi.github.com/open-data-certificate/certificate.html) is an **alpha version**. We are seeking feedback on:

  * whether it asks the right questions
  * whether the pilot/standard/established classification is correct
  * the usability of the form

We are particularly looking for feedback from data publishers who attempt to use the tool to create a certificate for their own data.

Let us know what you think by emailing [certificate@theodi.org](mailto:certificate@theodi.org) or by adding issues to this project.

Our longer-term aims are to provide back-end support for the certificate which would include:

  * automatically populating answers based on information available about the data at the documentation URL
  * automatically validating the answers that are provided
  * storing a copy of the completed certificates, and providing search, social and analytical interfaces over them

These requirements, and the avoidance of double-entry for data publishers, are behind the decision to request links for much of the information that is requested by the form.

## Technical Information

The HTML certificate is generated by transforming `certificate.xml` with `certificate.xsl` using an XSLT 2.0 processor such as [Saxon](http://saxonica.com).

The certificate uses [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) to support its dynamic user interface and, of course, [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for styling.

## Known Issues

  * The certificate itself does not get populated with all the information that you enter within the form.
  * There is no support for saving the certificate or anything else that would require a back-end server
