## ODI Open Data Certificate

The original prototype has been moved to [/prototype](https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/tree/master/prototype).

### Surveyor

The Open Data Certificate uses [surveyor](https://github.com/NUBIC/surveyor) to generate and display the data questionnaires.  We've changed the look, feel & structure to fit the site and extended it to support certificate levels.

#### Deploying questionnaires

Any changed surveys can be generated by running a rake task:

    # build all surveys in ./surveys
    rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys

    # specify a survey directory
    rake surveyor:build_changed_surveys DIR=surveys/development

#### Surveyor extensions

We've extended surveyor with some attributes for the open data certificate

##### survey

`:dataset_title` - Identifies which form element should be used to populate the dataset title

`:description` - Copy to be displayed above the questionnaire

##### question

`:required` - What level this question attains (eg - `:required`, `:pilot`)

`:help_text_more_url` - The url to link to at the end of the help text

`:text_as_statement` - How the text should appear when it's displayed on the certificate (eg. "What is your name?" should read as "Name")

`:display_on_certificate` - If the question should appear on the certificate

##### answer

`:requirement` - as above

`:help_text_more_url` - as above 

`:text_as_statement` - as above

`:input_type` - alternative input types (eg. url, number, phone)

`:placeholder` - placeholder text displayed in a field before anything is entered

The approach to the new app is outlined in a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/whiteoctober.co.uk/document/d/1Ot91x1enq9TW7YKpePytE-wA0r8l9dmNQLVi16ph-zg/edit#), which will be moved into this readme file.
